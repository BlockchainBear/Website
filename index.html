              <p>
                I attended george washington university for a degree in Political Science and a
                minor in english. I had palanned to become a speechwriter for politicans in the democractic party.
                However, things changed and I moved to new york city to sucessfuly pursue real estate. 
                having done some sales and many rentals, I saw that alot of the commercial clients in the area were tech companies.
                this inspired my interest into technology, so i have moved to San Francisco to study to become a software engeneer.

                I am currently enrolled in the Thinkful coding bootcamp in their
                Engineering Immersion program. I am enjoying it and hope to continue my carrer in technology

              <p>
                Coding has always been very interesting for me. having attended computer camps in the past. 
                What was interesting most to me was the vast amount of possibilities coding
                can be used for.

              <h3 class="second-headers">At Thinkful</h3>
              <p>
                With the guidance of the team at Thinkful, I plan to have a
                successful carrer working with code. It is, however, very
                challenging but I am positive that with hard work, dedication, and
                guidance I can overcome these obstacles and create cool stuff
                with other like-minded individuals.
